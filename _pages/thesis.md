## üìÑ Abstract  

With the rapid development of perception, communication and computation technologies, autonomous robots are expected to safely and intelligently operate in hazardous and cluttered environments. For nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots, this is particularly challenging due to their intrinsic kinematic constraints that prevent sideways motion, making traditional motion control strategies insufficient for such tasks.

This doctoral research focuses on designing **motion control algorithms for nonholonomic unicycle robots** in unknown cluttered environments using only **onboard sensing**.

- **Part I** tackles *source-seeking and collision avoidance* for a single robot in signal fields with obstacles. Key contributions include:
  - Projected gradient-ascent control design
  - Control barrier function (CBF) with **uniform relative degree**
  - Asymptotic convergence guarantees

- **Part II** extends to **multi-agent systems**, proposing:
  - A distributed CBF-QP framework for safe flocking with connectivity preservation
  - An **adaptive spacing policy** for flexible coordination

üß≠ In summary, this thesis presents novel control algorithms ensuring:  
**safety**, **stabilization**, **optimization feasibility**, and **group behavior flexibility**.
