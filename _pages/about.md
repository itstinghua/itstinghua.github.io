Hi, I am **Tinghua Li** (<font face="KaiTi">ÂéâÂ∫≠Âçé</font>). Welcome to my page!

I am currently a **postdoctoral researcher** at **Delft University of Technology**.  
In 2024, I obtained my PhD in Robotics and Control Engineering from the  
[Discrete Technology & Production Automation (DTPA) Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/discrete-technology-production-automation/?lang=en),  
**University of Groningen**, under the supervision of [Prof. Bayu Jayawardhana](https://www.rug.nl/staff/b.jayawardhana/?lang=en).

## üß† Research Interests

I work in the **control and robotics** field, focusing on:

- Theoretical motion control: *source seeking, flocking, collision avoidance*
- Practical sensor-based control of nonholonomic and multi-agent systems in cluttered environments

My interests span:

- Nonlinear control theory  
- Optimization analysis  
- Robotics: both software & hardware  

I‚Äôm especially passionate about developing **theoretical control methodologies** and implementing them in **realistic robotic systems**.
