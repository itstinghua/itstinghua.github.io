Hi, I am Tinghua Li (<font face="KAITi">厉庭华</font>). Welcome to my page!

I am currently a postdoc at Delft University of Technology. In 2024, I obtained my PhD in the robotics and control engineering, at [Discrete Technology & Production Automation (DTPA) Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/discrete-technology-production-automation/?lang=en), University of Groningen, where I worked with [Prof. Bayu Jayawardhana](https://www.rug.nl/staff/b.jayawardhana/?lang=en).

## Research Interests
I work in the **control and robotics** field, aiming at the theoretical motion control (e.g., source-seeking, flocking, collision avoidance) and practical sensory applications of nonholonomic and multi-agent autonomous systems in cluttered environments. My research interests span from nonlinear control theory, optimization analysis, and mechanics and robotics (software/hardware), and the passion particularly lies in theoretical control methodology development and further realistic robotics implementation.
