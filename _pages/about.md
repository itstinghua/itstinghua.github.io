Hi, I am Tinghua Li (厉庭华).


I'm currently a PhD candidate in robotics and control, at [Discrete Technology & Production Automation (DTPA)](https://www.rug.nl/research/discrete-technology-production-automation/?lang=en), University of Groningen, the Netherlands, under the supervison of [Prof. Bayu Jayawardhana](https://www.rug.nl/staff/b.jayawardhana/?lang=en) and [Prof. Ming Cao](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.cao/?lang=en/).

<br />

## Research Interests

I mainly work in the **control and robotics** field, aiming at the theoretical motion control (e.g., source-seeking, flocking, collision avoidance) and practical sensory applications of nonholonomic and multi-agent autonomous systems in cluttered environments. My research interests span from nonlinear control theory, optimization analysis, and mechanics and robotics (software/hardware), and the passion particularly lies in theoretical control methodology development and further realistic robotics implementation.

<br />

## Experimental Skills
**Software Programming & Development**
- Programming with C/C++/python/Matlab in Win/Linux system
- ROS/Gazebo/Matlab/Keil/Docker
- ORBSLAM2/Pointcloud mapping/Octomap
- Communication building with remote virtual machine/VPN/Opencv

**Hardware Debugging**
- STM32 ARM embedded programming/Arduino
- Airflow sensor/lidar/laser/RealSense Depth Camera D435i/ESP32 Wifi application
- Mecanum‑wheel Nexus Robotics

<br />
