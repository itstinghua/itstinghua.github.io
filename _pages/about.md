I'm currently a PhD candidate in robotics and control, at [Discrete Technology & Production Automation (DTPA)](https://www.rug.nl/research/discrete-technology-production-automation/?lang=en), University of Groningen, the Netherlands, under the supervison of [Prof. Bayu Jayawardhana](https://www.rug.nl/staff/b.jayawardhana/?lang=en) and [Prof. Ming Cao](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.cao/?lang=en/).

<br />

## Research Interests

I mainly work in the **control and robotics** field, aiming at the theoretical motion control (e.g., source-seeking, flocking, collision avoidance & CBF-based optimization) and practical sensory applications of nonholonomic and multi-agent autonomous systems in cluttered environments. My research interests span from nonlinear control theory, optimization analysis, and mechanics and robotics (software/hardware), and the passion particularly lies in theoretical control methodology development and further realistic robotics implementation.

 **Iâ€™m on the job market for potential postdoc opportunities in control & robotics, please feel free to contact me.**
