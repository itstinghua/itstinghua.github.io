    <h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9458274&tag=1">Source-seeking Robot</a></h3>
    <p>
      We present the design and experimental validation of source seeking control algorithms for a unicycle mobile robot that is equipped with novel 3D-printed flexible graphene-based piezoresistive airflow sensors. The proposed algorithm ensures convergence to the source even with partial sensor failure. Experimental validations demonstrate the efficacy of the methods.

    <h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735338">CBF-based Collision Avoidance Control</a></h3>
    <p>
      This work introduces a collision-free source-seeking control framework for unicycle robots traversing an unknown cluttered environment. It integrates control barrier functions (CBFs) in quadratic programming and provides a detailed analysis of three CBF designs. Simulations and experimental validations confirm the effectiveness of the methods.

    <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04576.pdf">Flocking Control with Connectivity Preservation</a></h3>
    <p>
      This project presents a distributed control method for networked multi-agent systems with non-holonomic constraints. Agents seek a source while maintaining flocking cohesion and avoiding collisions. The method guarantees connectivity preservation and ensures safe separation among agents in the network.
