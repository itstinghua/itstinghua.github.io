#### 2024
- **October:** I am excited that our work ["Collision-free Source Seeking Control Methods for Unicycle Robots"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735338) is **officially accepted for publication** in <i>**IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control**</i> ! As an important chapter of my PhD thesis, this work proposes three types of control barrier function (CBF) constructions to solve the mixed relative degree problem for implementing the CBF-QP on unicycle robot. I would particularly thank my dear supervisor Prof. Bayu Jayawardhana for all the inspiring discussions and steadfast support :)
<br>

- **June:** I am very honored to be the **keynote speaker at** the 6th **AI QianTang Forum**, School of Automation (School of Artificial Intelligence), Hangzhou Dianzi University, China. Thanks Prof. Jiming Chen and Prof. Jiuwen Cao for the warm invitation and welcome.

-  **January:** I have sucessfully defended my **Ph.D. thesis** ["Motion control for nonholonomic unicycle robots"](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/motion-control-for-nonholonomic-unicycle-robots)
 on 30 January, 2024. This thesis tackles the problems of source-seeking, collision avoidance using multi-input control barrier function, and flocking cohesion of multi-agent unicycle systems with guaranteed safety. The thesis presents both the experimental and theoretical aspects of control systems that solve these problems.
