-  **January:** I have sucessfully defended my Ph.D. thesis ["Motion control for nonholonomic unicycle robots"](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/motion-control-for-nonholonomic-unicycle-robots)
 on 30 January, 2024. This thesis tackles the problems of source-seeking, collision avoidance using multi-input control barrier function, and flocking cohesion of multi-agent unicycle systems with guaranteed safety. The thesis presents both the experimental and theoretical aspects of control systems that solve these problems.

#### 2023 
- **September:**  Joined the “Five decades of systems and control theory in Groningen” for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Systeemtheorie en Regeltechniek research group at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Groningen. 
- **June:**  Visited the research group of Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson in KTH, Sweden (June, 2023), and presented my work on "motion control for nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots". Many thanks for all the discussions and meetings! 
- **March, 2023:** Attended the 42nd benelux meeting on system and control (Elspeet, The Netherlands), presented our work "Collision-free Source Seeking and Flocking Control of Multi-agents with Connectivity Preservation", and got the DISC certificates!
